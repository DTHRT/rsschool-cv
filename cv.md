## Briefly About Myself:
I started my career at the age of 16 as a remote site administrator in a Moscow company. My duties then included maintaining the performance of sites and services by attracting freelance specialists. However, very often I came across unfair execution, solutions for which the company paid a lot of money sometimes simply stopped working and I did not understand why. This prompted me to start looking into everything myself. During my school years I attended private courses and through them I learned the basics of web development. However, real experience has shown that courses alone are not enough. Over the next 3 years, I had to deal with tasks of varying complexity, but thanks to them I learned how to google correctly and realized that there are no unsolvable problems in the world, at least in web development.

This thought allowed me to become more decisive and I stopped being afraid to take risks. In the Moscow company, I went from hiring remote freelancers to working independently. I started solving problems on my own without outside help. At first, these were problems related to html layout, but then I had the honor of creating new pages and sites.

A year ago, the company launched an ambitious project based on the Laravel framework. I started learning PHP with Laravel.

I can't say that I know php or js 100%. I study programming languages ​​and frameworks as the appropriate tasks come in.

In addition to working as an administrator, I also worked on a freelance site - kwork.ru, where I solved various problems with WordPress, made up landing pages and fixed bugs on sites.

Now I realized that I would like to gain experience in commercial development and specifically specialize in a certain area. I am determined and believe that it will help me become a Junior Frontend Developer.
