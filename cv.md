## Briefly About Myself:
I started my career at the age of 16 as a website administrator in a Moscow company. My responsibilities then included maintaining the performance of sites and services by attracting freelance specialists. However, very often I encountered unscrupulous performance of work. Solutions for which the company paid a lot of money sometimes simply stopped working and I did not understand why. This prompted me to start looking into the problems myself. During my school years I attended private courses and therefore I knew the basics of web development. However, real experience has shown that courses alone are not enough. For the next 3 years, I had to deal with tasks of varying complexity, but thanks to them, I learned how to google correctly and realized that there are no unsolvable problems in the world.

This thought allowed me to become more determined and self-confident.

I can't say that I know js, php or WordPress 100%. However, I try to constantly improve. I like to combine theory with real practice. I really like the feeling when you were able to step over yourself and solve a problem that seemed unsolvable.

In addition to working as an administrator, I also worked on a freelance site - [kwork.ru](https://kwork.ru/user/dthrt_yoo "my profile on kwork.ru"), where I very successfully solved various problems with WordPress, made up landing pages and fixed bugs on sites.

After a while, I realized that I want to grow further and become a full-fledged specialist in the field of Frontend development.
